Programming Assignment 2 - JAVA

The basic idea of this project was to create a gui which draws either a circle, rectangle, or right triangle depending on the user input.
The shapes can either be filled in with color or not. The shapes can also have a border of the same or differing color. The colors vary from red, gree, yellow, or blue. 

After the user has entered the data and selected from the menu, the shape is drawn on the screen at the user specified x and y coordinates.
Finally, the user has the option to write the information about the shape to a text file. This includes the shape's area, perimeter, color, and location within the X/Y axis. 

MVC - model, view, controller idea was also used for this project.

Model classes - Maintains the state and data that the application represents - holds the core of the application. If changes are made in the model, it updates all of its views. 

Controller class - This typically holds the use cases/main method. 

View classes - The user interface which displays information about the model to the user.
